# Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle
My computer science teacher has a physical version of the puzzle, I was playing with it a few days ago and he told me I should have a go at visualising it. 
I have been told that there are set ways to solve this puzzle however I created this program with only my experience playing with the physical puzzle. 
I am happy with my final solution. It was fun to implement a stack data structure and was good practice as it is the first project I have coded in a while.
